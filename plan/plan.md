# Plan

- install next, react, typescript âœ… 
- install mocha, chai, sinon(?) for testing ðŸš« Use Jest/React Testing Library instead for render/screen/fire event reasons âœ… 
- sort test script and typescript config âœ…
- plan out React components (excalidraw) & state âœ…
- set up file and folder structure âœ…
- create a test for a component (Jest/ React Testing Library) then work on code and back to tests etc. âœ…

        - GameBoard âœ…
        - GameButton âœ…
        - Index Page âœ…
        - EndGame âœ…
        
- Go component by component doing that and rendering them on the page as I go âœ…
- Fix issue where you have to click again after you have won for the game to update âœ… (FIXED - useEffect)
- research github actions âœ…
- try to automate tests with GitHub Actions âœ…
- Custom hooks âœ…
- Check I have done FP properly and tidy any 'any's âœ…
- CSS it âœ…
- Cypress tests âœ…
- deploy

## Functionality Planning
### Index.tsx should ...
- Hold win, lose or game in progress state, render either GameBoard or EndGame depending on this âœ…
- Hold logic for figuring whether anyone has won yet (to later be moved into custom hook) âœ…
- Hold true/false boolean state for noughts or crosses next. âœ…
- Hold on Click logic function and pass down to GameButton via GameBoard (or could make customhook) âœ…
- onClick function:  âœ…

        - puts an 0 or X on the button as text âœ…
        - updates the state so the next click puts X in if 0 last time etc. âœ…
        - updates a grid state with which button now has an X or 0 âœ…
        - disables the button after it has been clicked. âœ…
        - call the win checker function from index. âœ…
        - handleClick should just take (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) as arg âœ…

- EndGame rendered conditionally if win is true âœ…


## Use FP
- Pure functions âœ…
- Don't mutate data (map instead of for loops, push/pop/slice etc) âœ…
- Use higher order functions where necessary to abstract out functionality âœ…
- Declare variables with const and initialise at point of declaration âœ…
- Avoid Global Variables âœ…
