# Plan

- sort test script and typescript config ✅
- plan out React components (excalidraw) & state ✅

        - GameBoard ✅
        - GameButton ✅
        - Index Page ✅
        - EndGame ✅
        
- Go component by component doing that and rendering them on the page as I go ✅
- Fix issue where you have to click again after you have won for the game to update ✅ (FIXED - useEffect)
- research github actions
- try to automate tests with GitHub Actions
- Custom hooks
- Check I have done FP properly and tidy any 'any's
- CSS it
- Cypress tests
- deploy


## Use FP
- Pure functions
- Don't mutate data (map instead of for loops, push/pop/slice etc)
- Use higher order functions where necessary to abstract out functinality
- Declare variables with const and initialise at point of declaration
- Avoid Global Variables
