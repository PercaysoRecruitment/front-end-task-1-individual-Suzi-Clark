## The Challenge
The challenge is to create a website to play the classic game of tic-tac-toe. You must display the board and alow two users to take it in turns to place their counter on the board. A winning line is 3 of the same counter in a horizontal, vertical or diaganal path.

This website should be done using `Next` and `React` and written in `Typescript` because they are the technologies we use for our front end applications. You must think about using both unit tests (using either jest or mocha) and end-2-end tests (using cypress) of your website.

## Skills that should be covered
- Test Driven Design (TDD)
- Typescript
- Typescript fundamentals such as types
- Testing
- React and Next
- Git flow using GitHub
- Error checking
- (Bonus) Pipeline test automation

## Acceptance Criteria
- Create a website using NextJS and React.
- Split out your logic into helper files that can be fully unit tested.
- Two users can play on the same screen.
- A winning line is 3 of the same counter in a horizontal, vertical or diaganal path.

:warning: Googling syntax is allowed, googling solutions is not.

:warning: We would rather you spend time on the code and logic over the look and feel of the website. As long as it is usable then thats OK.

## Extra credit

If you're in the mood for showboating, plese feel free to show us what else you can do. E.g. you could automate tests for your solution and host your website.
